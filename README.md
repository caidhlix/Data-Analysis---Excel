# Data Analysis - Excel Task 1
As part of my Excel data analysis training, I was tasked with creating a table containing 20 rows of information. The table included specific fields such as Employee ID, Employee Full Name, Department (Communications, Sales, I.T), Salary (ranging from $5000 to $25000), and Job type (Part-time, Freelance, Contract). 
Excel concepts applied:

           •	Sorting data 
           •	Filtering data
           •	Removing duplicates
           •	Text to columns
           •	Splitting and joining cells
           •	Data validation
           •	Conditional formatting

## Problem Statement
	
           •	How can we create a table with 20 rows of employee information in worksheet 1, including Employee ID, Full Name, Department, Salary, and Job Type?
           •	How can we copy and paste the table from worksheet 1 into worksheet 2 and worksheet 3 in Excel?
           •	In worksheet 1, how can we filter and display only the 'Freelancer' employees and highlight those with salaries above $10000?
           •	In worksheet 2, how can we split employees' full names into first name and last name, check for duplicates, and highlight them without deleting any entries?

## Data Sourcing
As explicitly stated in the task, I generated the data in the Excel table, ensuring that it adheres precisely to the specified columns of Employee ID, Full Name, Department, Salary, and Job Type.

In worksheet 1, I filtered and displayed only the employees who are 'Freelancers' and highlighted those whose salaries are above $10000

## Sheet 2

In worksheet 2, I split the employees' full names into columns first name and last name, checked for duplicates, and highlighted them without deleting any entries

## Sheet 3

In worksheet 3, I highlighted employees whose names begin with the letter 'E' in yellow and formatted the Salary column such that the highest salary has a green background and the lowest salary has a red background
