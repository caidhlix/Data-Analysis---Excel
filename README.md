## Data Analysis - Excel Task 1
As part of my Excel data analysis training, I was tasked with creating a table containing 20 rows of information. The table included specific fields such as Employee ID, Employee Full Name, Department (Communications, Sales, I.T), Salary (ranging from $5000 to $25000), and Job type (Part-time, Freelance, Contract). 
Excel concepts applied:
           •	Sorting data 
           •	Filtering data
           •	Removing duplicates
           •	Text to columns
           •	Splitting and joining cells
           •	Data validation
           •	Conditional formatting.
