## Data Analysis - Excel Task 1
As part of my Excel data analysis training, I was tasked with creating a table containing 20 rows of information. The table included specific fields such as Employee ID, Employee Full Name, Department (Communications, Sales, I.T), Salary (ranging from $5000 to $25000), and Job type (Part-time, Freelance, Contract). This exercise allowed me to practice various data analysis techniques, such as sorting data, filtering data, removing duplicates, using text to columns, splitting and joining cells, applying data validation, and implementing conditional formatting.
